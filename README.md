# AI-and-algorithms
An assortment of programs testing AI concepts and algorithms

## Thanks for visiting
These programs were written specifically for assignments in an Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms class.
Unfortunately, I did not version control the files while writing the code so only the polished product has made it to GitHub.
That being said, these programs are optimized and perform well. These could serve as a reference for other students.

Pax,
Phil
